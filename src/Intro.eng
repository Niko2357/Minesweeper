Minesweeper is a game where mines are hidden somewhere in the shown field.
Before you choose a box, you need to have the right mode on. It's either a 'safe click' or 'mark a mine'.
You can undo a mark of mine by choosing it again with 'mark a mine' mode
First we write rows then columns. So first the number on the left the the upper numbers.
If there's a number, it shows how many mines are around the number. For example:

            0 1 2
         0  X X X
         1  X 1 X
         2  X X X

 In this field there are 8 hidden boxes where could be a mine.
If there's a -. It means there are no mines around.

            0 1 2
         0  X X X
         1  X 1 -
         2  - - -

In this case we can tell, that box 10 is definitely safe. Because of - next to it.
We mark mines with ðŸš© and if you click on a mine it explodes ðŸ’¥.

The goal in this game is to find all the mines and not to trigger one.
